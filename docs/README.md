This project seeks to explain the variance in parking ticket data and in particular answer the question "Are fewer tickets given out during inclement weather?"

To answer this and related questions, data was taken from NYC open data "Open parking and camera violations" linked here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Open-Parking-and-Camera-Violations/nc67-uf89 as well as NYC weather data taken from kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aadimator/nyc-weather-2016-to-2022

This data was cleaned, joined together then thoroughly explored and the results have been shared in the included reports.
